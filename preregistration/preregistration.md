# Background
Gestalt theory has been around for a while, and it was suggested that it was never initially proven, that people prefer art, in which they can recognize patterns and structures, before the experiment we try and reproduce. Therefore cubist art is chosen, since it is a mixture of forms, which need to be assembled by the viewer. After looking at the experiment we noticed, that only 20 people were tested and for those 20 people a strong correlation between likliness and understanding was suggested. We aim to have more participants doing our study to get a broader and more reliable result. 

# Research questions
Is there a relation between the recognition of patterns and structures and the likleness of a painting?


# Design of the Experiment

## General remarks about the design
what kind of a study is it (e.g., a 2x2 within-subjects factorial design)


## Sampling plan

Participants: We plan on recruiting as many participants as possible (e.g. friends, family, course members,…), but we would like to have at least 40, to give a broader outcome for the study.<br>
Restrictions: People with impaired colour vision and people with impaired vision (kurz-/weitsichtig) and without correction


## Materials

Online study built with babe including (html, Javascript and Css), the images from the original experiment. 

## Procedure

1. Group is randomly chosen and participant is asked to do one of three experiments, each containing 40 images out of the original pool of pictures.<br> 
2. Ensuring approx. Same size on every disply for all participants.<br>
3. Vision test: Vision is tested with Ishihara and Snellen testing, ensuring normal vision for all participants.<br> 
4. First round: Participants rates likleness of picture shown in random order on a scale of 1-7.<br> 
5. Second round Participant rates how well forms/patterns they are able to identify on a scale of 1-7

## Measured variables
• based on the design you described, what are the variables that you are going to measure <br> 
  • Variables measured: likleness on scale 1-7 <br>
  • how well they think they are able to identify patterns in scale 1-7 (1 being very bad and 7 being very good) <br>
• how will they be measured in the experiment? <br>
    Either pole or single numbers that can be clicked? <br>
• how will they be treated???? <br>


# Analysis Plan
• for single trial data: if they took longer than 30 secs to decide?<br> 
• for data from a whole participant:<br>
    if they rated all likleness/recognitions the same, if the answered in <1s if they took longer than 10s 5 or more trials if their         fvisual impairment is to high(define to high?)


## Exclusion criteria
  • for single trial data: if they took longer than 10 secs to decide?<br>
  • for data from a whole participant: if they rated all likleness/recognitions the same, if the answered in <1s if they took longer than 10s 5 or more trials if their visual impairment is to high(define to high?)


## Confirmatory hypothesis testing
  • if applicable, describe any transformations that you might want to apply to the data<br>
  • describe your statistical model <br>
        • e.g., we will use the ‘brms’ package to run a Bayesian regression model regressing <br>
        XYZ against A, B and C and their interactions<br>
  • describe by what means you will test the hypotheses mentioned earlier <br>
  • when you do this you will want to reformulate the hypotheses in a more precise fashion <br>
     • e.g., if H1 is true, we expect that parameter X is credibly bigger than zero in the posterior distribution <br>
