Background
Gestalt theory has been around for a while, and it was suggested that it was never initially proven, that people prefer art, in which they can recognize patterns and structures, before the experiment we try and reproduce. Therefore cubist art is chosen, since it is a mixture of forms, which need to be assembled by the viewer. After looking at the experiment we noticed, that only 20 people were tested and for those 20 people a strong correlation between likeliness and understanding was suggested. We aim to have more participants doing our study to get a broader and more reliable result.
Research questions
Is there a positive relation between the recognition of patterns and structures in and the likeliness of a cubist painting?
Design of the Experiment
General remarks about the design
    • what kind of a study is it (e.g., a 2x2 within-subjects factorial design) 
Sampling plan
Participants: We plan on recruiting as many participants as possible (e.g. friends, family, course members,…), but we would like to have at least 40, to give a broader outcome for the study.

Restrictions: People with impaired colour vision and people with impaired vision without correction (shortsightedness/longsightedness) 
Materials
    • Colour test
    • the images of the cubist paintings (from now on only to be called images) from the original experiment(120 cubist Paintings: Pablo Picasso (47),
      Georges Braque (33), and Juan Gris (40) format?, when? What type?(monochrome, colour)?)
Procedure
    1. „Do you consider yourself an expert in Cubist art?“ If you do, this experiment is unfortunately not for you!
    2. Group is randomly chosen and participant is assigned to one of three experiments, each containing 40 images out of the original pool of images.
    3. Ensuring approx. Same size of images and vision tests every screen for all participants.
    4. Vision test: Vision is tested with Ishihara and Snellen testing, ensuring normal vision for all participants.
    5. Trials?? 
    6. First round: Participants rate how well they like images shown in random order on a scale of 1-7*
    7. Second round Participants rate how well they are able to identify forms/patterns  in the whole image on a scale of 1-7* (in the same pictures from 4, randmoly mixed)
       *1 not at all- 7 very much
Measured variables
    • based on the design you described, what are the variables that you are going to measure
        ◦ Variables measured: likeliness on scale 1-7
        ◦ how well they think they are able to identify patterns1-7
    • how will they be measured in the experiment? 
          Single numbers to be clicked
    • how will they be treated 
           not at all- 7 very much
Analysis Plan
Exclusion criteria
    • for single trial data: 
        ◦ if they took longer than 1min to decide (to ensure that the participant is not to distracted)
        ◦ if they rated all likeliness/recognitions the same, if the answered in <3s 
    • whole participant data excluded:
        ◦  if 3 trials shorter than 3 sec
        ◦ Whole participant excluded if they took longer than 3 min for each of 5 continuos paintings
    • if they do not pass vision tests
      
Confirmatory hypothesis testing
    • if applicable, describe any transformations that you might want to apply to the data 
    • describe your statistical model 
        ◦ e.g., we will use the ‘brms’ package to run a Bayesian regression model regressing XYZ against A, B and C and their interactions 
    • describe by what means you will test the hypotheses mentioned earlier 
    • when you do this you will want to reformulate the hypotheses in a more precise fashion 
        ◦ e.g., if H1 is true, we expect that parameter X is credibly bigger than zero in the posterior distribution
